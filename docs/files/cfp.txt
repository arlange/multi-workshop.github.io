Call for Papers

11th International Workshop on Multi-Level Modeling (MULTI)

Co-located with the
    ACM / IEEE 27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)
    September 22 - 24, 2024

https://multi-workshop.github.io/

=======================================================================================================

MULTI 2024, to be held in conjunction with MODELS’24, Linz, Austria, will be the 11th workshop focusing on multi-level modeling. The MULTI workshop series is the premier venue for researchers and practitioners working on multi-level modeling and multi-level software development. Multi-level modeling represents a new object-oriented paradigm for both conceptual modeling and software en gineering. In contrast to conventional two-level approaches, it supports an un bounded number of classification levels and introduces concepts and mechanisms that foster reuse, adaptability, and control. While multi-level languages and tools have reached considerable maturity, the field still offers numerous challenges.

TOPICS
======

Topics for regular and position papers include, but are not limited to:

– the nature of elements in a multi-level hierarchy
– the importance and role of deep characterization mechanisms
– fundamental aspects of MLM, such as model composition and decomposition
– formal approaches to MLM
– integration of modeling and programming languages in a multi-level setting
– constraints in a multi-level setting
– definition of behavioral semantics in a multi-level setting
– industrial case studies
– applying MLM to large and/or real-world problems
– criteria and approaches for comparing MLM approaches

TYPES OF SUBMISSIONS
====================

MULTI 2024 solicits four kinds of papers:

- regular papers (10 pages)
- challenge submissions (10 pages)
- position papers (5 pages)
- industrial abstracts (2 pages)

Challenge papers are intended to elaborate a solution for the previously published MULTI challenges (https://multi-workshop.github.io/#challenge) thus presenting different modeling solutions, promoting a comparison between techniques and languages.

Industrial abstracts are intended to encourage the participation of authors from industry who are invited to present relevant multi-level modeling challenges they face in their fields promoting an exchange of knowledge between industry and academia.

IMPORTANT DATES
===============

Paper Submission    : July  5th, 2024
Author Notification : August 7th, 2024
Camera Ready Due    : August 16th, 2024
Workshop Date       : September 22-24th, 2024

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
==========================

Accepted papers will be included in the MODELS 2024 companion published by the ACM. 
Accepted industrial abstracts will be published on the MULTI 2024 workshop website.
